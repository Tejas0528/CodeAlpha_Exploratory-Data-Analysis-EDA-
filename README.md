# Exploratory-Data-Analysis(EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with sample_data.csv

This project demonstrates basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sample CSV dataset using Python. It is designed for beginners who want to learn how to explore and visualize data before building models.

The file 'sample_data.csv' contains fictional employee data with the following columns:

Column	Description

Name	Employee's name
Age	Employee's age
Gender	Employee's gender
Salary	Employee's monthly salary
Department	Department they belong to

Requirements

Install the required Python libraries using:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
How to Run
•	Clone the repository or download the files.
•	Make sure 'sample_data.csv' is in the same folder as the Python scripts.
•	Run the Python scripts using:
python eda_basic.py
python eda_advanced.py

Files

•	sample_data.csv – Sample employee dataset
•	eda_basic.py – Basic EDA (structure, summary, visualizations)
•	eda_advanced.py – Advanced EDA (correlation, scatter, heatmap)

Visualizations Included

•	Age distribution (histogram)
•	Salary by department (box plot)
•	Average salary by gender (bar plot)
•	Scatter plot (Age vs Salary)
•	Correlation heatmap

Concepts Covered

•	Asking questions of data
•	Data structure exploration
•	Summary statistics and missing value detection
•	Grouping and aggregation
•	Basic visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Ideal For
